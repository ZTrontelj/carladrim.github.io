6. Open a command prompt in administrator mode and type the following command

```sh
$ net start MongoDB
```

7. If an error saying *The service is not responding to the following function* appears, do the following
  * Change your current directory to *C:/mongodb/bin/* using the following command
  
  ```sh
  $ cd C:/mongodb/bin/
  ```
  
  * Type the following command
  
  ```sh
  $ mongod --remove
  ```
  
  * And then type the following command
  
  ```sh
  $ mongod --logpath c:\mongodb\log\mongo.log --dbpath c:\mongodb\data\db --directoryperdb --install
  ```
  
  * And finally type the following command
  
  ```sh
  $ net start MongoDB
  ```
  
8. Now you can execute the *mongo.exe* file in the *C:/mongodb/bin/* directory

#### How do I use MongoDB?

If you want to learn MongoDB more in depth, check its [documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/)

##### FOR THE TEST UNIT

You only need to create the databases and its collections. The databases will be local for now.

*Note*: Mind your uppercase and lowercase letters.

When you execute *mongo.exe*, you'll be met by a command prompt:

1. Type the following command to check the databases in your computer

```sh
$ show dbs
```
  
2. Type the following command to check which database you are using right now

```sh
$ db
```

3. Type the following command create and use a new database that will be called *users*

```sh
$ use orcwall
```

4. Type the following command create a new collection called *users*

```sh
$ db.createCollection('users')
```

5. Type the following command to check the collections inside your database

```sh
$ show collections
```

And that's all the MongoDB that you'll need to use.
